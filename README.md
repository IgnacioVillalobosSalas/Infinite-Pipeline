# Infinite-Pipeline unity3d 5.3

The game has two modes , survival , where you always travel at the same speed , and infinite speed where the 
speed is increasing constantly .You have to get the highest score you can. 

All the pipes are generated procedurally , you can play it in Android 2.3 or higher , IOS and Windows .

now a short demo recorded in my personal phone (One Plus 2) , sorry about the quality and those textures .
